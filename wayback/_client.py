This module provides a Python API for accessing versions (timestamped captures)
of a URL. There are existing open-source Python packages for the Internet
Archive API (the best-established one seems to be
https://internetarchive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) but none that expose the
list of versions of a URL.

    An enum describing the playback mode of a memento. When requesting a
    memento (e.g. with :meth:`wayback.WaybackClient.get_memento`), you can use
    these values to determine how the response body should be formatted.

    For more details, see:
    https://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/wayback/administrator_manual.html#Archival_URL_Replay_Mode

    Examples
    --------

    >>>                           mode=wayback.Mode.view)

    **Values**

    .. py:attribute:: original

        Returns the HTTP response body as originally captured.

    .. py:attribute:: view

        Formats the response body so it can be viewed with a web
        browser. URLs for links and subresources like scripts, stylesheets,
        images, etc. will be modified to point to the equivalent memento in the
        Wayback Machine so that the resulting page looks as similar as possible
        to how it would have appeared when originally captured. It's mainly meant
        for use with HTML pages. This is the playback mode you typically use when
        browsing the Wayback Machine with a web browser.

    .. py:attribute:: javascript

        Formats the response body by updating URLs, similar
        to ``Mode.view``, but designed for JavaScript instead of HTML.

    .. py:attribute:: css

        Formats the response body by updating URLs, similar to
        ``Mode.view``, but designed for CSS instead of HTML.

    .. py:attribute:: image

        formats the response body similar to ``Mode.view``, but

# HACK: handle malformed Content-Encoding headers from Wayback.
# When you send `Accept-Encoding: gzip` on a request for a memento, Wayback
# will faithfully gzip the response body. However, if the original response
# from the web server that was snapshotted was gzipped, Wayback screws up the
# `Content-Encoding` header on the memento response, leading any HTTP client to
# *not* decompress the gzipped body. Wayback folks have no clear timeline for
# a fix, hence the workaround here. More info in this issue:
# https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-processing/issues/309
#
# This subclass of urllib3's response class identifies the malformed headers
# and repairs them before instantiating the actual response object, so when it
# reads the body, it knows to decode it correctly.
#
# See what we're overriding from urllib3:
# https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/blob/a6ec68a5c5c5743c59fe5c62c635c929586c429b/src/urllib3/response.py#L499-L526

    backoff : int or float, default: 2

        subsequent retries increase by powers of 2:

            seconds = backoff * 2 ^ (retry number - 1)

        So if this was `4`, retries would happen after the following delays:
        0 seconds, 4 seconds, 8 seconds, 16 seconds, ...
    timeout : int or float or tuple of (int or float, int or float), default: 60

    search_calls_per_second : int or float, default: 1.5
        The maximum number of calls made to the search API per second.

    memento_calls_per_second : int or float, default: 30

        * Does not differentiate between HTTP and HTTPS,
        * Is not case-sensitive, and
        * Treats ``www.`` and ``www*.`` subdomains the same as no subdomain at
          all.

        This will automatically page through all results for a given search. If
        you want fewer results, you can stop iterating early:

        .. code-block:: python

          from itertools import islice
          first10 = list(islice(client.search(...), 10))

        Parameters
        ----------
        url : str
            The URL to search for captures of.

            Special patterns in ``url`` imply a value for the ``match_type``
            parameter and match multiple URLs:

            * If the URL starts with `*.` (e.g. ``*.epa.gov``) OR
              ``match_type='domain'``, the search will include all URLs at the
              given domain and its subdomains.
            * If the URL ends with `/*` (e.g. ``https://epa.gov/*``) OR
              ``match_type='prefix'``, the search will include all URLs that
              start with the text up to the ``*``.
            * Otherwise, this returns matches just for the requeted URL.

        match_type : str, optional
            Determines how to interpret the ``url`` parameter. It must be one of
            the following:

            * ``exact`` (default) returns results matching the requested URL
              (see notes about SURT above; this is not an exact string match of
              the URL you pass in).
            * ``prefix`` returns results that start with the requested URL.
            * ``host`` returns results from all URLs at the host in the
              requested URL.
            * ``domain`` returns results from all URLs at the domain or any
              subdomain of the requested URL.

            The default value is calculated based on the format of ``url``.

        limit : int, default: 1000
            Maximum number of results per request to the API (not the maximum
            number of results this function yields).

            Negative values return the most recent N results.

            Positive values are complicated! The search server will only scan so
            much data on each query, and if it finds fewer than ``limit``
            results before hitting its own internal limits, it will behave as if
            if there are no more results, even though there may be.

            Unfortunately, ideal values for ``limit`` aren't very predicatable
            because the search server combines data from different sources, and
            they do not all behave the same. Their parameters may also be
            changed over time.

            In general…

            * The default value should work well in typical cases.
            * For frequently captured URLs, you may want to set a higher value
              (e.g. 12,000) for more efficient querying.
            * For infrequently captured URLs, you may want to set a lower value
              (e.g. 100 or even 10) to ensure that your query does not hit
              internal limits before returning.
            * For extremely infrequently captured URLs, you may simply want to
              call ``search()`` multiple times with different, close together
              ``from_date`` and ``to_date`` values.

        offset : int, optional
            Skip the first N results.
        fast_latest : bool, optional
            Get faster results when using a negative value for ``limit``. It may
            return a variable number of results that doesn't match the value
            of ``limit``. For example,
            ``search('http://epa.gov', limit=-10, fast_latest=True)`` may return
            any number of results between 1 and 10.
        from_date : datetime or date, optional
            Only include captures after this date. Equivalent to the
            `from` argument in the CDX API. If it does not have a time zone, it
            is assumed to be in UTC.
        to_date : datetime or date, optional
            Only include captures before this date. Equivalent to the `to`
            argument in the CDX API. If it does not have a time zone, it is
            assumed to be in UTC.
        filter_field : str, optional
            A filter for any field in the results. Equivalent to the ``filter``
            argument in the CDX API. (format: ``[!]field:regex``)
        collapse : str, optional
            Collapse consecutive results that match on a given field. (format:
            `fieldname` or `fieldname:N` -- N is the number of chars to match.)
        resolve_revisits : bool, default: True
            Attempt to resolve ``warc/revisit`` records to their actual content
            type and response code. Not supported on all CDX servers.
        skip_malformed_results : bool, default: True
            If true, don't yield records that look like they have no actual
            memento associated with them. Some crawlers will erroneously
            attempt to capture bad URLs like
            ``http://mailto:someone@domain.com`` or
            ``http://data:image/jpeg;base64,AF34...`` and so on. This is a
            filter performed client side and is not a CDX API argument.

        Raises
        ------
        UnexpectedResponseFormat
            If the CDX response was not parseable.

        Yields
        ------
        version: CdxRecord
            A :class:`CdxRecord` encapsulating one capture or revisit

        Notes
        -----
        Several CDX API parameters are not relevant or handled automatically
        by this function. This does not support: `output`, `fl`,
        `showDupeCount`, `showSkipCount`, `lastSkipTimestamp`, `showNumPages`,
        `showPagedIndex`.

        It also does not support `page` and `pageSize` for
        pagination because they work differently from the `resumeKey` method
        this uses, and results do not include recent captures when using them.

        Fetch a memento (an archived HTTP response) from the Wayback Machine.

        Not all mementos can be successfully fetched (or “played back” in
        Wayback terms). In this case, ``get_memento`` can load the
        next-closest-in-time memento or it will raise
        :class:`wayback.exceptions.MementoPlaybackError` depending on the value
        of the ``exact`` and ``exact_redirects`` parameters (see more details
        below).

        Parameters
        ----------
        url : string or CdxRecord
            URL to retrieve a memento of. This can be any of:

            - A normal URL (e.g. ``http://www.noaa.gov/``). When using this
              form, you must also specify ``timestamp``.
            - A ``CdxRecord`` retrieved from
              :meth:`wayback.WaybackClient.search`.
            - A URL of the memento in Wayback, e.g.
              ``https://web.archive.org/web/20180816111911id_/http://www.noaa.gov/``

        timestamp : datetime.datetime or datetime.date or str, optional
            The time at which to retrieve a memento of ``url``. If ``url`` is
            a :class:`wayback.CdxRecord` or full memento URL, this parameter
            can be omitted.
        mode : wayback.Mode or str, default: wayback.Mode.original
            The playback mode of the memento. This determines whether the
            content of the returned memento is exactly as originally captured
            (the default) or modified in some way. See :class:`wayback.Mode`
            for a description of possible values.

            For more details, see:
            https://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/wayback/administrator_manual.html#Archival_URL_Replay_Mode

        exact : boolean, default: True
            If false and the requested memento either doesn't exist or can't be
            played back, this returns the closest-in-time memento to the
            requested one, so long as it is within ``target_window``. If there
            was no memento in the target window or if ``exact=True``, then this
            will raise :class:`wayback.exceptions.MementoPlaybackError`.
        exact_redirects : boolean, optional
            If false and the requested memento is a redirect whose *target*
            doesn't exist or can't be played back, this returns the
            closest-in-time memento to the intended target, so long as it is
            within ``target_window``. If unset, this will be the same as
            ``exact``.
        target_window : int, default: 86400
            If the memento is of a redirect, allow up to this many seconds
            between the capture of the redirect and the capture of the
            redirect's target URL. This window also applies to the first
            memento if ``exact=False`` and the originally
            requested memento was not available.
            Defaults to 86,400 (24 hours).
        follow_redirects : boolean, default: True
            If true (the default), ``get_memento`` will follow historical
            redirects to return the content that a web browser would have
            ultimately displayed at the requested URL and time, rather than the
            memento of an HTTP redirect response (i.e. a 3xx status code).
            That is, if ``http://example.com/a`` redirected to
            ``http://example.com/b``, then this method returns the memento for
            ``/a`` when ``follow_redirects=False`` and the memento for ``/b``
            when ``follow_redirects=True``.

        Returns

            #       the Wayback Machine itself.

            #       determine the same thing, but it's a little more complex...
            #       a) If the redirect *is* the memento, its target may be an
            #          actual memento (see #1) or it may be a redirect (#2).

            #          the same second to a few hours later, so it is likely
            #          the target will result in case 2b (below).
            #       b) If there is no memento for the requested time, but there
            #          are mementos for the same URL at another time, Wayback
            #          *may* redirect to that memento.

            #            of a memento redirect (2a), then this is expected.
