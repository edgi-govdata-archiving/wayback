This module provides a Python API for accessing versions (timestamped captures)
of a URL. There are existing open-source Python packages for the Internet
Archive API (the best-established one seems to be
https://internetarchive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) but none that expose the
list of versions of a URL.

Item from iterable of results returned by :meth:`WaybackClient.search`

These attributes contain information provided directly by CDX.

.. py:attribute:: digest

   Content hashed as a base 32 encoded SHA-1.

.. py:attribute:: key

   SURT-formatted URL

.. py:attribute:: length

   Size of captured content in bytes, such as :data:`2767`. This may be
   innacurate. If the record is a "revisit record", indicated by MIME type
   :data:`'warc/revisit'`, the length seems to be the length of the reference,
   not the length of the content itself.

.. py:attribute:: mime_type

   MIME type of record, such as :data:`'text/html'`, :data:`'warc/revisit'` or
   :data:`'unk'` ("unknown") if this information was not captured.

.. py:attribute:: status_code

   Status code returned by the server when the record was captured, such as
   :data:`200`. This is may be :data:`None` if the record is a revisit record.

.. py:attribute:: timestamp

   The capture time represented as a :class:`datetime.datetime`, such as
   :data:`datetime.datetime(1996, 12, 31, 23, 58, 47)`.

.. py:attribute:: url

   The URL that was captured by this record, such as

# HACK: handle malformed Content-Encoding headers from Wayback.
# When you send `Accept-Encoding: gzip` on a request for a memento, Wayback
# will faithfully gzip the response body. However, if the original response
# from the web server that was snapshotted was gzipped, Wayback screws up the
# `Content-Encoding` header on the memento response, leading any HTTP client to
# *not* decompress the gzipped body. Wayback folks have no clear timeline for
# a fix, hence the workaround here. More info in this issue:
# https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-processing/issues/309
#
# This subclass of urllib3's response class identifies the malformed headers
# and repairs them before instantiating the actual response object, so when it
# reads the body, it knows to decode it correctly.
#
# See what we're overriding from urllib3:
# https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/blob/a6ec68a5c5c5743c59fe5c62c635c929586c429b/src/urllib3/response.py#L499-L526

        limit : int, optional
            Maximum number of results per page (this iterator will continue to
            move through all pages unless `showResumeKey=False`, though).
        offset : int, optional
            Skip the first N results.
        fastLatest : bool, optional
            Get faster results when using a negative value for `limit`. It may
            return a variable number of results.
        gzip : bool, optional
            Whether output should be gzipped.
        from_date : datetime or date, optional
            Only include captures after this date. Equivalent to the
            `from` argument in the CDX API. If it does not have a time zone, it
            is assumed to be in UTC.
        to_date : datetime or date, optional
            Only include captures before this date. Equivalent to the `to`
            argument in the CDX API. If it does not have a time zone, it is
            assumed to be in UTC.
        filter_field : str, optional
            A filter for any field in the results. Equivalent to the `filter`
            argument in the CDX API. (format: `[!]field:regex`)
        collapse : str, optional
            Collapse consecutive results that match on a given field. (format:
            `fieldname` or `fieldname:N` -- N is the number of chars to match.)
        showResumeKey : bool, optional
            If False, don't continue to iterate through all pages of results.
            The default value is True
        resumeKey : str, optional
            Start returning results from a specified resumption point/offset.
            The value for this is supplied by the previous page of results when
            `showResumeKey` is True.
        page : int, optional
            If using paging start from this page number (note: paging, as
            opposed to the using `resumeKey` is somewhat complicated because
            of the interplay with indexes and index sizes).
        pageSize : int, optional
            The number of index blocks to examine for each page of results.
            Index blocks generally cover about 3,000 items, so setting
            `pageSize=1` might return anywhere from 0 to 3,000 results per page.
        resolveRevists : bool, optional
            Attempt to resolve `warc/revisit` records to their actual content
            type and response code. Not supported on all CDX servers. Defaults
            to True.
        skip_malformed_results : bool, optional
            If true, don't yield records that look like they have no actual
            memento associated with them. Some crawlers will erroneously
            attempt to capture bad URLs like `http://mailto:someone@domain.com`
            or `http://data:image/jpeg;base64,AF34...` and so on. This is a
            filter performed client side and is not a CDX API argument.
            (Default: True)
        previous_result : str, optional
            *For internal use.* The CDX API sometimes returns repeated results.
            This is used to track the previous result so we can filter out the
            repeats.
        **kwargs
            Any additional CDX API options.

        Raises
        ------
        UnexpectedResponseFormat
            If the CDX response was not parseable.

        Fetch a memento from the Wayback Machine. This retrieves the content

        that were present at the time the memento was captured. (That is, if
        `http://example.com/a` redirected to `http://example.com/b`, this
        returns the memento for `/b` when you request `/a`.)

        Parameters
        ----------
        url : string
            URL of memento in Wayback (e.g.
            `http://web.archive.org/web/20180816111911id_/http://www.nws.noaa.gov/sp/`)
        exact : boolean, optional
            If false and the requested memento either doesn't exist or can't be
            played back, this returns the closest-in-time memento to the
            requested one, so long as it is within `target_window`.
            Default: True
        exact_redirects : boolean, optional
            If false and the requested memento is a redirect whose *target*
            doesn't exist or or can't be played back, this returns the closest-
            in-time memento to the intended target, so long as it is within
            `target_window`. If unset, this will be the same as `exact`.
        target_window : int, optional
            If the memento is of a redirect, allow up to this many seconds
            between the capture of the redirect and the capture of the target
            URL. (Note this does NOT apply when the originally requested
            memento didn't exist and wayback redirects to the next-closest-in-
            -time one. That will always raise a MementoPlaybackError.)

            redirects], check `debug_history` instead of `history`.)
