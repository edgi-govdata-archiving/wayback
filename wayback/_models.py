Item from iterable of results returned by :meth:`WaybackClient.search`

These attributes contain information provided directly by CDX.

.. py:attribute:: digest

   Content hashed as a base 32 encoded SHA-1.

.. py:attribute:: key

   SURT-formatted URL

.. py:attribute:: length

   Size of captured content in bytes, such as :data:`2767`. This may be
   inaccurate, and may even be :data:`None` instead of an integer. If the record is a
   "revisit record", indicated by MIME type :data:`'warc/revisit'`, the length
   seems to be the length of the reference, not the length of the content
   itself. In other cases, the record has no length information at all, and
   this attribute will be :data:`None` instead of a number.

.. py:attribute:: mime_type

   MIME type of record, such as :data:`'text/html'`, :data:`'warc/revisit'` or
   :data:`'unk'` ("unknown") if this information was not captured.

.. py:attribute:: status_code

   Status code returned by the server when the record was captured, such as
   :data:`200`. This is may be :data:`None` if the record is a revisit record.

.. py:attribute:: timestamp

   The capture time represented as a :class:`datetime.datetime`, such as
   :data:`datetime.datetime(1996, 12, 31, 23, 58, 47, tzinfo=timezone.utc)`.

.. py:attribute:: url

   The URL that was captured by this record, such as
   :data:`'http://www.nasa.gov/'`.

And these attributes are synthesized from the information provided by CDX.

.. py:attribute:: raw_url

   The URL to the raw captured content, such as
   :data:`'https://web.archive.org/web/19961231235847id_/http://www.nasa.gov/'`.

.. py:attribute:: view_url

   The URL to the public view on Wayback Machine. In this view, the links and
   some subresources in the document are rewritten to point to Wayback URLs.
   There is also a navigation panel around the content. Example URL:
   :data:`'https://web.archive.org/web/19961231235847/http://www.nasa.gov/'`.

class Memento:
    """
    Represents a memento (an archived HTTP response). This object is similar to
    a response object from the popular "Requests" package, although it has some
    differences designed to differentiate historical information vs. current
    metadata about the stored memento (for example, the ``headers`` attribute
    lists the headers recorded in the memento, and does not include additional
    headers that provide metadata about the Wayback Machine).

    Note that, like an HTTP response, this object represents a potentially open
    network connection to the Wayback Machine. Reading the ``content`` or
    ``text`` attributes will read all the data being received and close the
    connection automatically, but if you do not read those properties, you must
    make sure to call ``close()`` to close to connection. Alternatively, you
    can use a Memento as a context manager. The connection will be closed for
    you when the context ends:

        >>> with a_memento:
        >>>     do_something()
        >>> # Connection is automatically closed here.

    **Fields**

    .. py:attribute:: encoding
        :type: str

        The text encoding of the response, e.g. ``'utf-8'``.

    .. py:attribute:: headers
        :type: dict

        A dict representing the headers of the archived HTTP response. The keys
        are case-insensitive. If you iterate over it, you will receive the
        header names as they were originally sent. However, you can look them
        up via strings that vary in upper/lower-case. For example::

          list(memento.headers) == ['Content-Type', 'Date']
          memento.headers['Content-Type'] == memento.headers['content-type']

    .. py:attribute:: history
        :type: tuple[wayback.Memento]

        A list of :class:`wayback.Memento` objects that were redirects and were
        followed to produce this memento.

    .. py:attribute:: debug_history
        :type: tuple[str]

        List of all URLs redirects followed in order to produce this memento.
        These are "memento URLs" -- that is, they are absolute URLs to the
        Wayback machine like
        ``https://web.archive.org/web/20180816111911id_/http://www.noaa.gov/``,
        rather than URLs of captured redirects, like ``http://www.noaa.gov``.
        Many of the URLs in this list do not represent actual mementos.

    .. py:attribute:: status_code
        :type: int

        The HTTP status code of the archived HTTP response.

    .. py:attribute:: mode
        :type: str

        The playback mode used to produce the Memento.

    .. py:attribute:: timestamp
        :type: datetime.datetime

        The time the memento was originally captured. This includes ``tzinfo``,
        and will always be in UTC.

    .. py:attribute:: url
        :type: str

        The URL that the memento represents, e.g. ``http://www.noaa.gov``.

    .. py:attribute:: memento_url
        :type: str

        The URL at which the memento was fetched from the Wayback Machine, e.g.
        ``https://web.archive.org/web/20180816111911id_/http://www.noaa.gov/``.

    .. py:attribute:: ok
        :type: bool

        Whether the response had an non-error status (i.e. < 400).

    .. py:attribute:: is_redirect
        :type: bool

        Whether the response was a redirect (i.e. had a 3xx status).

    .. py:attribute:: content
        :type: bytes

        The body of the archived HTTP response in bytes.

    .. py:attribute:: text
        :type: str

        The body of the archived HTTP response decoded as a string.
