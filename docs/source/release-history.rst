Release History
===============

v0.2.3 (2020-03-25)
-------------------

This release downgrades the minimum Python version to 3.6! You can now use
Wayback in places like Google Colab.

The ``from_date`` and ``to_date`` arguments for
:meth:`wayback.WaybackClient.search` can now be ``datetime.date`` instances
in addition to ``datetime.datetime``.

Huge thanks to @edsu for implementing both of these!

v0.2.2 (2020-02-13)
-------------------

When errors were raised or redirects were involved in
``WaybackClient.get_memento()``, it was previously possible for connections to
be left hanging open. Wayback now works harder to make sure connections aren't
left open.

This release also updates the default user agent string to include the repo
URL. It now looks like:
``wayback/0.2.2 (+https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/wayback)``

v0.2.1 (2019-12-01)
-------------------

All custom exceptions raised publicly and used internally are now exposed via
a new module, :mod:`wayback.exceptions`.

v0.2.0 (2019-11-26)
-------------------

Initial release of this project. See v0.1 below for information about a
separate project with the same name that has since been removed from PyPI.

v0.1
----

This version number is reserved because it was the last published release of a
separate Python project also named ``wayback`` that has since been deleted from
the Python Package Index and subsequently superseded by this one. That project,
which focused on the Wayback Machine's timemap API, was maintained by Jeff
Goettsch (username ``jgoettsch`` on the Python Package Index). Its source code
is still available on BitBucket at https://bitbucket.org/jgoettsch/py-wayback/.
