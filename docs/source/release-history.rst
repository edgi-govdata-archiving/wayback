v0.2.1 (2019-12-01)
-------------------

All custom exceptions raised publicly and used internally are now exposed via
a new module, :mod:`wayback.exceptions`.

v0.2.0 (2019-11-26)
-------------------

Initial release of this project. See v0.1 below for information about a
separate project with the same name that has since been removed from PyPI.

v0.1
----

This version number is reserved because it was the last published release of a
separate Python project also named ``wayback`` that has since been deleted from
the Python Package Index and subsequently superseded by this one. That project,
which focused on the Wayback Machine's timemap API, was maintained by Jeff
Goettsch (username ``jgoettsch`` on the Python Package Index). Its source code
is still available on BitBucket at https://bitbucket.org/jgoettsch/py-wayback/.
