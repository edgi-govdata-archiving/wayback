*Wayback* is A Python API to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. It gives you tools to search for and load mementos (captured historical copies of web pages).

The Internet Archive has an official `“internetarchive” <https://archive.org/services/docs/api/internetarchive/>`_ package, but it is mainly concerned with the APIs and tools that manage the Internet Archive as a whole: managing items and collections. These are how e-books, audio recordings, movies, and other content are managed. It doesn’t, however, provide particularly good tools for finding or loading historical captures of specific URLs (i.e. the part of the Internet Archive called the “Wayback Machine”). That’s what the *wayback* package does.
