Installation
************

This package uses new features of Python and it requires Python 3.6+.
The easiest way to get a modern version of Python is to
`install conda <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation>`_.
Happily, conda will not interfere with any existing Python installation(s), and
it does not require administrative access to your machine.

Instructions for a development installation:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-processing
    cd web-monitoring-processing
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .

The package is not yet distributed on PyPI.
