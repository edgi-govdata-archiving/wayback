/*
   Sphinx v2 and sphinx_rtd_theme are not *quite* compatible. The markup output
   for definition lists in Sphinx 2 is slightly different, and requires a theme
   to add separators between terms (which are function parameter names in most
   cases) and their classifiers (the parameter's types, like `date`).

   For more, see:
